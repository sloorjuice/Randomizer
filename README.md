# Randomizer
  A python program that saves and removes items to a list using a GUI that can also select a random item in the list.\
  I made this as a program to select a random game in my playstation libaray as i am very indecisve and playstation does not have a "suprise me" button like xbox.

## How to
  Download the files along with the requirements.\
  Run the python file.

  This is the GUI:\
