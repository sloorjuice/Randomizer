# Randomizer
  A Python program that saves and removes items to a list using a GUI that can also select a random item from the list.\
  I made this as a program to select a random game in my PlayStation library as I am very indecisive, and PlayStation does not have a "surprise me" button like Xbox.

## How to
  Download the files along with the requirements.\
  Run the Python file.

  This is the GUI:\
  ![random](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c4159a1-8156-4f3b-8020-90e57d24ccec)

  Press the random button to select a random item from the items.txt file.\
  Press the add button to add a new item to the items.txt file.\
  Press the remove button to remove a selected item from the items.txt file.\

  Press the list button to display all items:\
  ![more random](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb3f8b2-c9f5-47d3-ac19-01939c1ecc2e)\
  You can change the items per column in the main.py file.

  Obviously, press quit to quit.
